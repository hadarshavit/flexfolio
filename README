OVERVIEW
  xfolio is an algorithm selection tool. 
  It is written in Python (Serie 2.7) and uses external binaries
  as, e.g., clasp to determine an algorithm schedule.
  
  Detailed information, source code, are available at: https://bitbucket.org/mlindauer/xfolio

RESTRICTIONS

  xfolio in the current version only selects algorithms wrt 
  optimization of runtime on decision problems.
  
REQUIREMENTS:

  * Python 2.7
  * numpy, liac-arff and scikit learn (tested with 0.15.0; http://scikit-learn.org/dev/index.html):
    pip install -U scikit-learn
    Requirements of scikit learn: 
      sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-numpy python-setuptools python-scipy libatlas-dev libatlas3-base
  * To use "--approach ASPEED" or "--aspeed-opt", you need to have executable binaries of gringo (Serie 3), clasp (Serie 2.1) 
    and the runsolver (http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~roussel/runsolver/) in ./binaries
    In addition, write permissions are needed in the current directory (".") for temporary files

TRAINING:
  To train xfolio, a directory with files in the ASlib format (--coseal-dir) has to be provided (see aslib.net). 
  Furthermore, you have to provide a dictionary for model related files:
  	--modeldir 				directory for saving models (ATTENTION: overwrites old files!)
