OVERVIEW
  claspfolio is an algorithm selection tool. It is primarly designed for 
  solving ASP problems (in lparse format). But it supports theoretically
  also all other Boolean Constraint areas. 
  
  claspfolio is written in Python (Serie 2.7) and uses external binaries
  as, e.g., claspre.
  
  Detailed information, source code, are available at: http://potassco.sourceforge.net/

RESTRICTIONS

  claspfolio 2.0 in the current version only selects algorithms wrt 
  optimization of runtime on decision problems within a cutoff of 600 seconds
  claspfolio 2.0 does not support  any useful selection strategy for optimization problems

REQUIREMENTS:

  * Python 2.7
  * numpy, liac-arff and scikit learn (tested with 0.14.1; http://scikit-learn.org/dev/index.html):
    pip install -U scikit-learn
    Requirements of scikit learn: 
      sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-numpy python-setuptools python-scipy libatlas-dev libatlas3-base
  * To use "--approach ASPEED" or "--aspeed-opt", you need to have executable binaries of gringo (Serie 3), clasp (Serie 2.1) 
    and the runsolver (http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~roussel/runsolver/) in ./binaries
    In addition, write permissions are needed in the current directory (".") for temporary files
  * To extract features with claspre, claspre (Serie 2) has to be in ./binaries as an executable binary

USAGE
  claspfolio reads(grounded) problem instances from a given file (e.g., problem.lp).
  In addition, a further parameter has to be specified
    --configfile <file> : configuration file with all necessary information about trained models (e.g., can be found in ./models/release2.1/config.json)
 
  echo "a." | ./binaries/gringo | python src/claspfolio.py -I - -C models/release2.1/config.json
  or
  python src/claspfolio.py -I problem.lp -C models/release2.1/config.json
  
  For further parameters, call:
    python src/claspfolio.py -h
    
TRAINING:
  To train claspfolio, a directory with files in the ASlib format (--coseal-dir) has to be provided (see aslib.net). 
  Furthermore you have to decide for:
  	--modeldir 				directory for saving models (ATTENTION: overwrites old files!)
  	
  claspfolio-2.1.0 was trained with:
  	python src/trainer/main_train.py --coseal-dir models/release2.1/training/ --model-dir ./models/release2.1/ --crossfold -1
  	
  For further parameters, call:
    	python src/trainer/main_train.py -h
